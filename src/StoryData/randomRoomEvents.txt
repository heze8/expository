something twitched in your peripherals
the air... is chilly
your heartbeat beats loud in the silence
a gentle gust..
the monitor flickering across the room
you lean against the wall... observing
a peculiar rectangular countour on the wall
a singular picture frame hangs behind the monitor
the room is incredibly vacant...
cold... where does it come from
clean and hollow...
the monitor silent and still
